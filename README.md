## New York Voting Data and Demographic Data

The packages not in requirements.txt: cenpy and time

The goal of this project was to look at demographic data in comparison with voting data. This would hopefully allow us to see some correlation between different demographic categories and their voting patterns, both for overall voting turnout and candidates.

### Demographic Areas
#### Sex and Age
For the “Sex and Age” dataset,  the areas viewed were a collection of age ranges: 18 - 19, 20 - 24, 25 - 34, 35 - 44, 45 - 54, 55 - 64, 65 - 74, 75 - 84, over 85, and the total population size. These age ranges were all separated by sex and county.

#### Race:
For the  “Race” dataset, the areas viewed were various race groupings: ‘Total population’, ‘Two or more races: Two races including Some other race’, ‘Some other race alone’, ‘Two or more races’, ‘Two or more races excluding Some other race, and three or more races’, ‘white alone’,  ‘Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone’, ‘Asian alone’, ‘American Indian and Alaska Native’, and ‘Black or African American alone.’

#### Education:
For the “Education” dataset, the areas viewed were various education levels: ‘12th grade, no diploma’, ‘High school graduate (includes equivalency)’, ‘Professional school degree’, ‘Some college, 1 or more years, no degree,’ ‘Associate’s degree’, ‘Bachelor’s degree’, ‘Master’s degree’, and ‘Doctorate degree.’ These areas were separated by gender and also included the total population for both males and females.

#### Health Insurance:
For the “Education” dataset, the areas viewed were separated by with health insurance, or without health insurance. These were further separated by gender and age ranges: 19 - 25, 26 - 34, 35 - 44, 45 - 54, 55 - 64, 65 - 74, and 75 years and over.

#### Income:
For the “Income” dataset, each section was split by gender, time worked (either full-time, or other), and the dollar amount was adjusted for 2019 inflation.

#### Housing:
For the “Housing” dataset, each area was separated by living alone, which was further separated by gender and type (living alone, with only nonrelatives, with children, or with relatives and no children). There were also areas of married couple households and cohabiting households, which were separated by living with children or having no children.
